# Machine Learning Text Classification

## Overview
This project explores text classification using machine learning techniques on the **20 Newsgroups dataset**. The goal is to classify textual data into different news categories using various models, including:
- **Linear Models**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Neural Networks**

The project demonstrates how different machine learning algorithms perform on text data and compares their accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset: 20 Newsgroups
The **20 Newsgroups dataset** consists of approximately 20,000 news articles categorized into 20 different topics. It is a standard dataset used in text classification and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset
   - Text cleaning and vectorization (TF-IDF)
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Train classifiers: Linear Models, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification reports
3. **Comparison & Insights**:
   - Compare model performance
   - Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each approach

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Results & Observations
The results include accuracy metrics and performance comparisons of different models. These insights help in understanding which model works best for text classification tasks.

## Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to text classification using different machine learning techniques. It provides a practical demonstration of working with textual data and comparing model performances.
